[   {     "CMakeLists.txt": "Review and modify the include directories to avoid using absolute paths prefixed with the source directory. Use CMake variables like ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR} or ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} to construct paths. Ensure the use of target_include_directories with the appropriate scope (PUBLIC, PRIVATE, INTERFACE) to propagate paths correctly. Check for any typos or incorrect paths that might lead to incorrect directory references."   } ]
